# WinME-on-K8s

**Project Name**: Expose a Kubernetes Cluster Running WinME Emulated Containers to the Open Internet, Securely

**Overview**: This project showcases familiarity with containers, Kubernetes, operating system emulation, network security, and demonstrates an ability to think creatively about atypical, complex cloud security situations.

**Objective**: Expose a Kubernetes Cluster running WinME emulated containers to the open internet, then deploy the emulated WinME system inside a container as an application in the Kubernetes cluster.

**Procedure:**

**Step 1: Hardware Preparation**

1. Purchase a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. The model with 4GB of RAM is usually sufficient, but the 8GB model provides more headroom for future projects.

2. Also purchase the following items:
   - Micro SD card (at least 32GB, but 64GB is recommended for more space)
   - Ethernet cable (to connect your Raspberry Pi to your network)
   - Micro HDMI to HDMI cable (to connect your Raspberry Pi to a monitor for setup)
   - USB-C power supply (to power your Raspberry Pi)
   - Keyboard and mouse for initial setup

3. Once having all your hardware:
   - Insert the Micro SD card into your computer.
   - Connect the Ethernet cable to your Raspberry Pi and your router.
   - Connect the HDMI cable to your Raspberry Pi and your monitor.
   - Plug in your keyboard and mouse.
   - Finally, plug in the power supply to power up the Raspberry Pi.
